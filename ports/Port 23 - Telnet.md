If port **23** is open, Telnet is likely running. This is another way to remotely log into a computer.

```bash
telnet <IP>
```
to log in using telnet you will need:

- A **valid username**
    
- A **password**
    

like [[Port 22 - SSH (Secure Shell)]]], the password could be brute forced using [[Hydra â€“ Login Bruteforce#telnet]]  
ðŸš¨remember, only try brute force if you're told something like "weak credentials" or "default password still in use" â€” most of the time it's not allowed.
