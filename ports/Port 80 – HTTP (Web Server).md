If port 80 is open on your target, it usually means there's a website hosted on the server.

would recommend to open it in your browser and look thru it, could find some interesting information.

after you went thru the site you should use [[Gobuster â€“ Directory & File Bruteforcer]] to find hidden directories that can hide secrets and even private pages left by mistake.
like:
- Configuration files
    
- Admin panels
    
- Forgotten dev/test pages
    
- Sensitive data accidentally left behind
