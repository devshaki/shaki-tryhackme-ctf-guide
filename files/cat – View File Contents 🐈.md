**cat** is used to display the contents of a file right in the terminal.  
Itâ€™s one of the fastest ways to read flags, config files, credentials, and scripts.

basic usage:
```bash
cat <file>
```
examples:
```bash
cat user.txt
cat /root/root.txt
```

## ðŸ’¡shaki pro tip

you could combine cat with more commands like [[Grep â€“ Search for Text in Files]]

example:
```bash
cat config.php | grep pass
```
