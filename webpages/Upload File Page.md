Upload file page is one of the best pages to find imo
If it's not properly secured, you might be able to upload a malicious file (like a [[PHP Webshell ‚Äì Remote Command Execution]]) and gain command execution on the target machine.

## üîç what to look for!
	we are looking for a webpage that lets us upload file.
	and have access to our file thru the website.
	for example a image upload file site - the site lets us upload a image and
	view it in the web.

we can try to upload a [[PHP Webshell ‚Äì Remote Command Execution]] instead of a image to try and gain shell to the target server
