a easy way to find exploits by names

## basic usage:

```bash
searchsploit name
```
### for example:
```bash
searchsploit apache
searchsploit "Linux Kernel 4.4"
searchsploit CVE-2021-3156
```

## exploit to your current directory:
```bash
searchsploit -m <exploit_id>
```
*(Replace `<exploit_id>` with the ID number from the search results)*

ðŸš¨**the paths are relative to /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/**
